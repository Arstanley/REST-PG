I used to never section my hair - didn't know about it and wasn't sure of the point.  But then I realized that (1) I tended to do a good job at first and then rush though when I got tired and (2) unruly hair is easier to manage in small sections.  So, I use these clips daily to help keep my hair looking like I love myself.  Having so many is nice because I don't have to worry about losing some.  I also use them to keep my hair drying bonnet from opening up due to the air pressure.  And, I use them to hold my towel closed.  BUT, oftentimes, the silicone breaks.  So, I wanted a large quantity to help make up for this.  So, I deducted a star due to the lack of durability of the silicone - once it breaks, the hold feels much, much firmer.  I wish that there was a way to reattach it.  But, all in all, this is a great value in terms of quantity but could be better in durability.", "P": ["[5 stars] Comfortable tortoise headbands - These headbands are comfortable - they have enough give to smooth down the hair without too much tension.
